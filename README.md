# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

The following repo contains some older samples of my work, when I first started coding.

Some of these projects are no longer live.

# [Fresh links](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/fresh_links)

Fresh links was a cloud-based RSS reader built with WordPress. The userâ€™s posts appeared in a timeline and are stripped free of ads, superfluous HTML, and with their full text. The articles could be automatically deleted after a user set amount of time, listed in the timeline indefinitely, or saved into a separate section. [Here's recording](https://natedelacruz.com/fresh-links) of it.

`WordPress`, `PHP`, `JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

# [descrambler](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/descrambler)

This is a simple descrambler I made as part of a coding assessment for a potential employer several years ago. To descramble the initial message, click "descramble". You can then put any chunk of text into the textarea to create a scrambled message. You can see the live version [here](https://descrambler-35eb1.web.app/).

`JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

# [Mr Meteor](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/fresh_links)

Mr Meteor was the portfolio site of a Boston-based animation studio. It showcased short animation, comics, and original art. The site is a custom WordPress theme designed to anticipate the clientâ€™s needs, allowing for minute control over styling thus permitting a wide variety of content. [Here's recording](https://natedelacruz.com/mr-meteor) of it.
